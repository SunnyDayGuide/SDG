		<p>The “quiet beaches” on Delaware’s southern coast are the perfect places for a relaxing day in the sun, fun activities and a thriving culinary scene. From Lewes in the north, through Rehoboth and down to Bethany and Fenwick, these beaches are a nice break from the hustle of the large cities nearby. Yet these beach towns host an amazing variety of thrilling amusements, activities, and incredible festivals. In this year-round resort area, you’ll also find mini-golf courses, go-kart tracks and even some waterslides. In the summer, take a kayak out on the water or jump some waves on a Jet Ski. Being able to have fun in the sun is a major draw for many to the Delaware coast.</p>
		<h3>Great Food</h3>
		<p>If you are really into great cuisine, Delaware is the right place for dining options. Feast on a variety of foods from fries, ice cream and snacks to seafood or prime rib at high-end restaurants. Dig into succulent crab cakes, platters of steamed shrimp or a perfectly grilled juicy steak. Rehoboth in particular is well-known for its flair for creative and delicious food, but you’ll find fantastic restaurants throughout the region.</p>
		<h3>Exciting Shopping</h3>
		<p>Fenwick, Bethany, Dewey, Rehoboth and Lewes play host to exciting festivals and shows. Artisans display and sell their wares at the various craft shows held in the area throughout the year.  Fabulous local artists and popular brands are also waiting to be discovered on your next shopping excursion. Whether you’re searching for a swimsuit, a souvenir or the perfect outfit for a night on the town, our shops are sure to surprise! Plus, all shopping is tax-free which saves you money!</p>
