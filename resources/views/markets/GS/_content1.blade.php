		<p>Welcome to Branson, Missouri! Everything you could want for a fabulous vacation can be found here—exciting activities, entertaining shows, gourmet meals, unique shopping opportunities, and even a dancing fountain.</p>
		<p>The city is probably most famous for its many shows that are hosted in grand theaters with more seats available for spectators than in all of New York City. Bring your family and friends for a performance that will leave you laughing, singing, or even dancing in the aisles. You can choose to see magicians, comedians, concerts and tribute bands, or original acts and circus stunts.</p>
		<p>But that’s not all Branson is famous for… Located in the foothills of the Ozarks and surrounded by Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo, outdoor adventures await intrepid explorers. Ever visit a cave or go on a hunt for Bigfoot? Well, you can do that here! Maybe go hiking in the hills or zip-line over them—your choice! Plus there are many exciting things to do on the water including boat tours on yachts and paddleboats, paddleboarding, jet skiing, and so much more.</p>
