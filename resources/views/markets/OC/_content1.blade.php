		<p>Excitement is in the air in Ocean City, Maryland! Welcome to a place where families return year after year in pursuit of a vacation destination that everyone will enjoy.  There’s so much to see and do in this coastal town, it can be hard to decide where to start! Rent Jet Skis, paddleboards, or kayaks and spend the day on the water. Many companies offer boat tours to see marine wildlife or the Assateague ponies. Fishing is also a popular pastime on the local waters. Sign up for a tournament and try to hook the prize-winning fish.</p>
		<p>In addition to playing in the water—either in the bay or in the ocean—no visitor should miss the electric atmosphere of the Ocean City boardwalk. This is the mid-Atlantic’s version of Coney Island. The two-mile-long boardwalk has games, rides, food, shops, and a distinct sense of nostalgia. Take a ride on the tram to see it all in comfort or rent a surrey and pedal your way along the boards with two or three friends.</p>
