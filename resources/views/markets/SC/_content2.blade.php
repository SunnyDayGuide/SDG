		<p>Journey east across the bridge on the Sanibel Causeway to see more of the region by visiting Fort Myers Beach on the islands of Estero and San Carlos. Here, you’ll find beaches with soft, white sand and many other things to see and do. Separate from the city of Fort Myers, this little community offers an abundance of watersports, restaurants, and shops. Fort Myers Beach even has its own Times Square—well, a southern low-key area where locals like to congregate. It’s a great place to grab a drink, window shop, and people-watch!</p>
		<p>With such a wide variety of experiences to try, everyone in the family is certain to have a wonderful time on the islands. Be sure to check back here for coupons to save money on activities, dining, and shopping.</p>
